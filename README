spmv-hip
----------

Example program for computing a sparse matrix-vector multiplication with a
matrix in the compressed sparse row (CSR) and ELLPACK formats.

Compiling on eXÂ³
--------------

AMD

    The ROCm toolchain is installed on n004 (mi100q). Run the following command
    to compile for AMD and produce the binary `spmv-hip-amd`:

        $ make clean amd

NVIDIA

    To compile for NVIDIA, the ROCm toolchain is still required, i.e., it is
    still required to be on n004. To produce the binary `spmv-hip-nvidia`, run
    the following commands:

        $ module load cuda11.0/toolkit/11.0.3
        $ make clean nvidia

ANSI C library for Matrix Market I/O
------------------------------------

The files `src/mmio.h` and `src/mmio.c` are from the "NIST ANSI C library for Matrix Market I/O"
(https://math.nist.gov/MatrixMarket/mmio-c.html).
